At school, she is fawned over by boys and girls alike, and she graciously welcomes it all as a natural reaction to her irresistible charm. That is, until she comes across Medaka Kuroiwa, the boy who is seemingly immune to her overwhelming charisma. She goes out of her way to talk to him and even dials her cuteness up a notch, but no matter what she tries, Mona cannot wipe the scowl off Kuroiwa's face. \r\n \r\nBacked into a corner, Mona is forced to use the most devastating weapon in her arsenal: her physical allure. Such drastic measures would leave other boys foaming at their mouths, but Kuroiwa remains unfazed by her attempts. Little does Mona know that the only reason Kuroiwa just barely abstains from succumbing to her charms is because he is training to be a monk and thus trying his best not to be held down by worldly pleasures. As Mona goes all out to entice Kuroiwa, she fails to realize that his unintentional chivalry might just make her fall for him instead. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "score": NaN, "ranked": NaN, "popularity": 5534, "members": 15818, "genre": ["Comedy", "Romance", "Love Status Quo", "School", "Shounen"], "demographic": "Shounen", "img_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1792/146404.jpg", "episodes": "Unknown", "aired": "Jan 2025 to ?"},

Her next favorite thing to do is try to set up Subaru with their veterinarian friend Seishirou Sakurazuka who, oddly enough, is always readily available to accompany the Sumeragis throughout the city. \r\n \r\nSubaru has to resolve a variety of spiritual conflicts in Tokyo: some are cases formally brought to him by clients, and others are matters in which he decides to involve himself.

Hokuto hopes that if Subaru develops feelings for Seishirou, their relationship will be the one thing that he never gives up for the sake of anyone else.

But because of their destructive fire fighting ways, they too are feared by the town folk. Almost every night, Akaneko and the Mizuneko Fire Brigade fight fiercely, taking down many of the town's buildings in the process. The Mizuneko Fire Brigade have depleted most of the town's financial resources so the town ends up on the verge of bankruptcy. The town was in a critical state when Chinka, a girl with a superhuman ability to smell out fires appears. With her powers, the Mizuneko Fire Brigade close in on the true identity of Akaneko... \r\n \r\n(Source: ANN, paraphrased)", "score": 5.01, "ranked": NaN, "popularity": 16383, "members": 540, "genre": ["Action"], "demographic": "Unknown", "img_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/71467.jpg", "episodes": "1", "aired": "Mar 31, 2010"},

Frightened, all the animals fled their homes and ran out of the forest. As they came to the edge of a stream they stopped to watch the fire and they were feeling very discouraged and powerless. They were all bemoaning the destruction of their homes. Every one of them thought there was nothing they could do about the fire, except for one little hummingbird. \r\n \r\nThis particular hummingbird decided it would do something. It swooped into the stream and picked up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire. Then it went back to the stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again. All the other animals watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, \"Don't bother, it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it\u2019s only a drop, you can't put out this fire.\" \r\n \r\nAnd as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird\u2019s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless and forlorn they looked. Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a mocking voice, \"What do you think you are doing?\" And the hummingbird, without wasting time or losing a beat, looked back and said, \"I am doing what I can.\" \r\n \r\n(Source: sechangersoi.be)", "score": NaN, "ranked": 20621, "popularity": 22587, "members": 133, "genre": ["Kids"], "demographic": "Kids", "img_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1561/98614.jpg", "episodes": "1", "aired": "2009"},
