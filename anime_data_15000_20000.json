Here he is welcomed by a bevy of kimono-wearing lovelies who lead him to a stately court full of musicians and dancers. As a ballerina pirouettes on the palace floor in front of him, he is plied with alcohol and handed a small gift box, before being escorted to a giant scallop shell that rises through the water taking him back to the surface. When he returns home, he finds he has aged so much that his wife and son no longer recognise him. He opens the gift box and a hideous demon springs from it and squashes him beneath its fists, at which point the man wakes up, and realising that the events of this story have all been a terrible nightmare, hurries out to work, alerted to the potential dangers of a life spent in idle daydreaming. \r\n \r\n(Source: midnighteye.com)", "score": NaN, "ranked": 17842, "popularity": 18570, "members": 348, "genre": ["Supernatural"], "demographic": "Unknown", "img_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1768/143423.jpg", "episodes": "1", "aired": "1925"},

The men were called \"TEN\", looking rather scary, but when speaking, they were all full of heart in spite of the blunt words. One day a nice couple visited this place and took Ken (the cutest) to their home. They seemed to have no children and promised to make him happy. Every one envied him. A gorgeous car arrived. Yet it had the face of the \"SHINDU\" which by force would take away the children. They were called \"SARAIYA\" among the children. Children ran away all at once, but Takashi couldn't make it and was caught and taken into the car. The other children and \"TEN\" prayed, saying \"This can't be helped.\" The car went through a big gate and arrived at the place called \"JAIL\". He asked the \"MIHARI\" who would patrol, why he should be treated like this, and a cold answer came back. \"You will be executed in three days.\" Three days later, judged by the guards, Takashi was executed. The fact is that in the pet world this happens as a matter of fact, while this is a forcible and absurd procedure in man\u2019s world. The story was replaced in the Buddha's world. \r\n \r\n(Source: Official Site)", "score": NaN, "ranked": 17996, "popularity": 19747, "members": 277, "genre": ["Drama"], "demographic": "Unknown", "img_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82091.jpg", "episodes": "1", "aired": "Aug 30, 2010"},

Like the previous movie, the stories deal with seeing the world through the eyes of people who are different from social norms.  The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature in 2008 from the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. \r\n \r\n1. \"The Third Wish\u201d (AN Dong-hui, RYU Jeong-wu). A fairy godmother appears before a visually impaired young woman to grant her three wishes. But this is no fairytale. The irritable middle-aged fairy wants to finish her job as soon as possible. Yet she proves to be helpful as she leads the woman through a busy marketplace, which is delightfully reminiscent of \"Amelie\". But it's no walk in the park, as busy urbanites show no consideration for our protagonist. Yet she prevails through obstacles. With a walking stick, she taps together the heels of her shiny new shoes and follows the \"yellow brick road\" (guiding tiles for the visually impaired) around the city. \r\n \r\n2. \"Ajukari\u201d (HONG Deok-pyo) is a street-style cartoon. It comically depicts how a certain macho \"complex\" can cripple men. Male circumcision becomes the ultimate standard for being \"manly\" and those who have failed to do the deed are forever fearful of going to public baths. \r\n \r\n3. \"Baby\" (LEE Hong-su, LEE Hong-min) portrays the difficulties a career woman faces in having a child. \"I'm not saying you can't have maternity leave, but can you afford to raise a child while working?\" asks her boss. This smart story portrays everything from mother and daughter-in-law relationships to a parody of \"Tazza: The High Rollers\" and hilarious episodes where an \"ambulance bus\" picks up several patients en route. \r\n \r\n4. \"Shine Shine Shining\" (KWON Mi-jeong) is drawn like a warm, watercolor storybook for children. Grade schooler Eun-jin is smart and popular, but she has a secret. She hides her curly hair, which she gets from her Filipino mother, in braids. \r\n \r\n5. \"Merry Golasmas\" is an adorable claymation, or stop motion animation of models constructed from clay, plasticine, etc. It explores physical discrimination or stereotypes. In an open audition to find a Santa Claus, the real Santas \u2015 one who's black, another who's Asian, a female Santa and one in a wheelchair \u2015 lose to a fake Santa, a pot-bellied, Caucasian. \r\n \r\n6. \u201cLies\" explores homosexuality. Drawn in pastel-like sketches with art deco-esque details, it is a stunning digital cut-out animation, A homosexual man is forced by his parents to marry a woman, while others are pressured to fake having a girlfriend or receive \"therapy\" to become straight. \r\n \r\n(Source: The Korean Times)", "score": NaN, "ranked": 19393, "popularity": 18120, "members": 384, "genre": ["Drama", "Psychological"], "demographic": "Unknown", "img_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/26149.jpg", "episodes": "6", "aired": "Apr 17, 2008"},

He's a timid boy, who always wakes Grandpa up to accompany him when he has to go to the outhouse in the middle of the night. The shadow of the giant horse-chestnut tree in the yard scares him. \r\n \r\nGrandpa tells him that just once a year, on November 20, a single brave child sees a light in the tree, but Mameta is still too scared and goes to sleep. But that very night, Grandpa suffers from intense stomach pain, and Mameta, forgetting his fears, races barefoot down the mountain to summon the doctor. On the way back up the mountain, the doctor carries him piggyback, and from his perch on the doctor's back, Mameta sees a light in the tree.  \r\nEven so, the next night and the night after, he continues to ask Grandpa to go with him to the outhouse. \r\n \r\nThe moral of the story is summarized in Grandpa's words to Mameta: \"You should never think of yourself as weak or timid. So long as you have caring in your heart, you'll find that you'll be able to do what needs doing.\" \r\n \r\n(Source: booksfromjapan.jp)", "score": NaN, "ranked": 17482, "popularity": 19826, "members": 273, "genre": ["Drama", "Kids"], "demographic": "Kids", "img_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/65125.jpg", "episodes": "1", "aired": "Jun 21, 1992"},

It is about the injury of rigid religious upbringing to a teenager who discovers the strange and terrifying reality behind fundamentalism. Warped into an ultra-religious environment from a young age, his surroundings force him to adhere to a rigid and sometimes irrational world-view. He eventually succumbs to the madness, and lives consumed by guilt while devouring every crumb of false hope thrown at him from his religious community. One day he gathers the courage to leave his faith behind, and sees that human existence is actually a more nuanced experience than the black and white reality in which he grew up in. By using metaphors of signs and symbols, the animation highlights and describes the mental illness caused by the conservative church on the lead character and illustrates how the character makes his way out from his dire situation. \r\n \r\n(Source: IMDB)", "score": NaN, "ranked": 16212, "popularity": 20790, "members": 219, "genre": ["Drama", "Suspense", "Psychological"], "demographic": "Unknown", "img_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1931/126758.jpg", "episodes": "1", "aired": "Oct 14, 2017"},

This ruthless star devours anything that comes in close contact, whether it is life, substance, or even light. The most avid adventurers don't dare to even mention going there, because of the risk. Until one day, a man in fiery red clothing declared to the whole universe: \"In the deepest part of black hole, lies a mysterious place called Rainbow Sea. A place full of precious stones, rivers of gold and rainbow covered skies. Anyone who gets there gets all their wishes granted.\" This declaration ignited the enthusiasm of the whole universe, attracting people from everywhere. They followed the man in red into the black hole, and ultimately no one came back. The adventurers that vanished with the man in red were called the descendants of the loathful \"Red Devil\" and Rainbow Sea was then considered as history's biggest lie ever. \r\n \r\nTen years later, the son of Mailin, Maidang, is a teenager who grew up on Earth. In order to fulfill his promise with his dad, he was determined to set off in search of rumored Rainbow Sea. Thanks to the rainbow stone, left by his dad, he obtained himself a magical ability: the ability to fight using cooking techniques. Eventually he destroyed the no-fly facility set up by the Evil Galactic Eye organization on Earth.
